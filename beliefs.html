          </p>
        </div>
      </div> -->

      <div class="text bottom-space">
        <p><strong>I. The Scriptures</strong></p>
        <p>We believe that the Holy Bible is Godâ€™s word, and it contains the
          means of our salvation. It reveals the principles by which God judges
          us; and therefore is, and will remain to the end of the world, the
          true center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all
          human conduct, creeds, and religious opinions should be tried. All
          Scripture is a testimony to Christ, who is Himself the focus of
          divine revelation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>II. God</strong></p>
        <p>We believe that there is only one God, who is all powerful and all
          knowing. As creations of God, we owe Him our love, reverence, and
          obedience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>III. Salvation</strong></p>
        <p>We believe that salvation is offered freely to all who accept Jesus
          Christ as Lord and Saviour, who by His own blood obtained eternal
          redemption for the believer. Salvation involves the redemption of the
          whole man, and there is no salvation apart from personal faith in
          Jesus Christ as Lord.
        </p>

        <p><strong>IV. The Church</strong></p>
        <p>We believe that the church is the body of Christ. In our
          congregation, each member is responsible and accountable to Christ as
          Lord. Its scriptural officers are pastors and deacons. While both men
          and women are gifted for service in the church, the office of pastor
          is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.
        </p>

        <p><strong>V. Evangelicalism and Missions</strong></p>
        <p>It is the duty and privilege of every follower of Christ and of
          every church of the Lord Jesus Christ to endeavor to make disciples
          of all nations. The new birth of man's spirit by God's Holy Spirit
          means the birth of love for others. Missionary effort on the part of
          all rests thus upon a spiritual necessity of the regenerate life, and
          is expressly and repeatedly commanded in the teachings of Christ. The
          Lord Jesus Christ has commanded the preaching of the gospel to all
          nations. It is the duty of every child of God to seek constantly to
          win the lost to Christ by verbal witness undergirded by a Christian
          lifestyle, and by other methods in harmony with the gospel of Christ.
